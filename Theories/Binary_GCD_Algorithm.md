The binary GCD algorithm, also known as Stein's algorithm, is an efficient algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers. 
It has a time complexity of O(log n), which is faster than the Euclidean algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(log n) for two input numbers n and m.

The binary GCD algorithm works by repeatedly applying the following steps until the two input numbers are equal:
  1. If either number is zero, return the other number as the GCD.
  2. If both numbers are even, divide them both by 2 and repeat the process.
  3. If one number is even and the other is odd, divide the even number by 2 and repeat the process.
  4. If both numbers are odd, set one of the numbers to the absolute difference between them and repeat the process.
  5. 
The binary GCD algorithm is particularly well-suited for calculating the GCD of two large numbers, since it avoids the expensive division operations used in the Euclidean algorithm. 
However, it is not as widely used as the Euclidean algorithm due to its somewhat more complex implementation.
